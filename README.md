# FireBench

**FireBench** is a Python library designed for the systematic benchmarking and inter-comparison of fire models.
Recent advancements in fire modeling have introduced complex and varied models, but there is a lack of systematic evaluation regarding their accuracy, efficiency, sensitivity, validity domain, and inter-compatibility.
FireBench aims to address this gap by providing a framework to assess fire models on the following criteria:

- **Accuracy**: Precision in predicting fire front positions and plume dynamics.
- **Efficiency**: Computational resources required for specific computation.
- **Sensitivity**: Model outputs' responsiveness to input variations, crucial for calibration and data assimilation.
- **Validity Domain**: Operational input ranges for which models are applicable.
- **Inter-Compatibility**: Integration capabilities with other models.

FireBench offers a dual approach for evaluation: intercomparison without extensive observational data and benchmarking against a validation dataset. This framework aims to enhance fire modeling for both scientific research and operational applications, with results archived in a dedicated database.
