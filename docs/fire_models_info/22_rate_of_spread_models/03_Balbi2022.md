# Balbi_2022_fixed_SFIRE
## Description

The Balbi rate of spread model [1], recently extended by Chatellon et al. in 2022 [2, 3], is a physical-based model designed to predict the rate at which wildfires spread, particularly within shrubland ecosystems. Unlike empirical models, the Balbi model accounts for detailed physical interactions between fuel characteristics, atmospheric conditions, and fire behavior, offering a robust framework for modeling fire spread in complex vegetation types. The 2022 extension specifically adapts the model for field-scale shrubland fires, incorporating the effects of environmental variables such as wind and slope on flame dynamics and heat transfer processes. This version refines the model's application to heterogeneous fuel beds, enhancing its predictive accuracy and reliability for real-world fire conditions.

## Usage

### General use
The Balbi_2022_fixed_SFIRE model is a class derived from `firebench.ros_models.RateOfSpreadModel`.
```python
# Import rate of spread package from firebench
import firebench.ros_models as rm
# create the input dictionnary with the inputs listed above
model_inputs = {...}
# compute the rate of spread
ros = rm.Balbi_2022_fixed_SFIRE.compute_ros(model_inputs)
```

### Use with Anderson13 fuel model

The [Anderson13](../21_fuel_models/02_Anderson.md) fuel model provides a set of fuel properties that can be linked to Balbi's inputs. The following diagram shows the workflow that can be used to connect Anderson fuel model and Balbi rate of spread model.

Fig. 1 shows an example of usage with Anderson fuel model.
It uses constant environemental inputs for wind, slope and fuel moisture. 
It also uses the wind reduction factor from Anderson fuel model.

### Use with Scott and Burgan fuel model

The [Scott and Burgan](../21_fuel_models/03_SB40.md) fuel model provides a set of fuel properties that can be linked to Balbi's inputs. The following diagram shows the workflow that can be used to connect Scott and Burgan fuel model and Balbi rate of spread model.

Fig. 2 shows an example of usage with Scott and Burgan fuel model.
It uses constant environemental inputs for wind, slope and fuel moisture. 
As all the inputs needed for Rothermel_SFIRE are not directly present in SB40, we need to complement the inputs from another source of information or to combine SB40 properties together.
For example, the fuel load input for Rothermel is the sum of the fuel loads for the different fuel sizes in Scott and Burgan.
As Scott and Burgan dataset does not contain the fuel density and wind reduction factors, we can use a correspodance table to get this information from Anderson fuel model instead.
It also uses the wind reduction factor from Anderson fuel model.
