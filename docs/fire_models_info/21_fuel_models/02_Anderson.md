# Anderson 13 fuel model
## Description
The Anderson 13 fuel model, also known as the Albini 13, is a widely recognized system used in wildfire modeling to categorize vegetation types based on their burning characteristics. Developed by Hal Anderson in the 1980s [1], these models classify surface fuels into 13 groups based on parameters such as fuel load, moisture content, and expected fire behavior. Each fuel model provides an idealized description of vegetation structure, from fine grasses and brush to timber and logging slash, enabling prediction of flame length, fire spread rate, and intensity under given environmental conditions.

## Usage

Import the Anderson fuel model data using `FireBench` with:
```python
import firebench.tools as ft
fuel_data = ft.import_anderson_13_fuel_model()
```
The data is stored in the dictionnary `fuel_data`. The keys are the standard variable names and the values are numpy array associated with pint unit.

## Compatibility with fire models

Compatibility levels:
- **Full**: The data contained in the fuel model covers *all* the fuel input needed by the fire model
- **Partial**: The data contained in the fuel model covers *some* of the fuel input needed by the fire model
- **None**: The data contained in the fuel model covers *none* of the fuel input needed by the fire model
